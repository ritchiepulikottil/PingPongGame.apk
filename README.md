# PingPongGame.apk using Kivy framework and Buildozer
#PingPong is a two-dimensional sports game that resembles table tennis.

#It requires two players and each player controls an in-game paddle to hit the ping pong ball back and forth.

#The player gains a point when the player two misses to hit the ball.

#Kivy is a free and open source Python library for developing mobile apps and

other multitouch application software with a natural user interface.

# Bugs
#The velocity increases over time, hence after a while its almost impossible to control the ball

#The ball might start off with a weird direction due to the values produced by RandInt function. In such cases, simply restart the .py file

#Sometimes the ball is caught inside the paddle and the score increases invariably.

#Hence make sure that the ball hits the surface of the paddle to avoid this bug.
