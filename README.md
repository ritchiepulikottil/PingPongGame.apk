# Bugs
#The velocity increases over time, hence after a while its almost impossible to control the ball

#The ball might start off with a weird direction due to the values produced by RandInt function. In such cases, simply restart the .py file

#Sometimes the ball is caught inside the paddle and the score increases invariably.

#Hence make sure that the ball hits the surface of the paddle to avoid this bug.
